# ECE P 520: Software Engineering for Embedded Applications

Modern embedded systems programming starts with the hardware and extends all the way to the cloud. The resulting myriad of programming languages, libraries, tools, data structures, and algorithms may seem difficult for any one programmer to master. In this course, we introduce the fundamentals of programming languages and software engineering common to all levels of embedded systems programming, giving students the conceptual tools they need to tackle any project.

Specifically, this course takes a detailed look at two programming languages, C++ and Javascript; teaches students how to use build tools, version control, and advanced editors; describes how to use and create software libraries; and ties everything together with a more substantial software engineering project.

**Lectures**: Thurs 6pm - 9pm

**Homework**: Due weekly

**Instructor**: Prof. Eric Klavins. Office hours: TBA

**Teaching Assistant**: TBA

## Syllabus

* Week 1: Basic tools: Git, Docker, Make, UNIX, and the C compiler
* Week 2: C syntax and data types, the C preprocessor, io, and building APIs
* Week 3: Unit testing and automatic documentation generation
* Week 4: Fundamentals of C++ and object oriented programming
* Week 5: Event loops, process control, and scheduling
* Week 6: Programming sensors and effectors
* Week 7: Networking
* Week 8: Cloud computing
* Week 9: Javascript and asynchronous process control
* Week 10: Projects

## Homework

Homework will be assigned weekly, and will be due the following Wednesday. Homework will be submitted by pushing your code and other materials to a github repository. We will clone your code and attempt to run it and grade it based on functionality, completeness, and style. Code is expected to be documented and have associated unit tests. 

Detailed assignments are listed on the [wiki](https://github.com/klavinslab/ECE90-f18/wiki).

## Resources

* We will be using [Github](https://github.com/) for version controlling all of our code. 
* Please use the Visual Studio [Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to edit your code for this course.
* [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) unit testing environment
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container creation and management system
* [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/) language documentation
* [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/) API documentation generator
